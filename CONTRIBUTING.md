## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Project-Tick/ProjT-Launcher.git
cd ProjT-Launcher
cmake --preset your_os
cmake --build --preset your_os
ctest --preset your_os
```

---

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
| --------- | ----------- |
| CMake | 3.22+ |
| Qt | 6.10.0 |
| Compiler | C++20 support |
| Python | 3.9+ (for metadata tools) |
| Node.js | 18+ (for website) |

**Why exact Qt version?** ABI stability and CI determinism require all builds to use the same Qt version. Mixing versions causes subtle runtime failures.

---

## Project Areas

```yaml
launcher/           Launcher application (C++/Qt)
website/            Website (Eleventy)
bot/                Automation bot (Cloudflare Workers)
meta/               Metadata generator (Python)
docs/               Documentation
ci/, .github/       CI/CD and automation
scripts/, tools/    Build and development tools
```

### Detached Fork Libraries

These are independently maintained forks, not synced with upstream:

```yaml
zlib/               Compression library
bzip2/              Compression library
quazip/             ZIP archive handling
cmark/              Markdown parsing
tomlplusplus/       TOML parsing
libqrencode/        QR code generation
libnbtplusplus/     NBT format support
extra-cmake-modules/    CMake utilities
```

### Vendored Libraries

```yaml
gamemode/           GameMode integration
LocalPeer/          Single instance support
murmur2/            Hash functions
qdcss/              Dark CSS support
rainbow/            Terminal colors
systeminfo/         System information
```

---

## Code Style

This is a summary. See [CODE_STYLE.md](docs/contributing/CODE_STYLE.md) for full rules.

### C++ (clang-format)

```sh
clang-format -i path/to/file.cpp
```

Key rules:

- Tabs for indentation (width: 4)
- Column limit: 120
- Allman brace style
- C++20 standard

### Commit Messages

```text
component: short description

Optional explanation of what and why.
```

Examples:

```text
launcher: fix crash on startup with invalid config
zlib: update to version 1.3.1
ci: add macOS arm64 build support
docs: update build instructions
```

---

## DCO Sign-off

Every commit must include a sign-off line:

```sh
git commit -s -m "component: description"
```

This adds:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The bot enforces DCO compliance and labels MRs missing sign-off.

## Merge Request Process

### Before Submitting

- Run clang-format on changed files
- Ensure code compiles without warnings
- Add tests for new functionality
- Sign off all commits
- Update documentation if needed

### MR Requirements

- Clear description of what and why
- Reference related issues
- Pass all CI checks
- One logical change per MR
- **Do not mix**: refactors, features, and third-party updates must be in separate MRs
- Third-party library updates require standalone MRs with documented rationale

### Review Process

1. Automated CI runs tests and linting
2. Maintainer reviews code
3. Address feedback
4. Merge when approved

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```sh
ctest --preset default
```

### Running Specific Tests

```sh
ctest -R test_name --preset default
```

### Writing Tests

- Use QtTest framework
- Test public interfaces
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases

---

## Architecture

The launcher follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:

```yaml
Model       Data and business logic
ViewModel   Presentation logic, state management
View        Qt Widgets UI components
```

MVVM is enforced conceptually. UI classes (`launcher/ui/`) must not contain business logic—only presentation and user interaction. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full design guidance.

## Documentation

See `docs/` for detailed documentation:

- [docs/contributing/](docs/contributing/) - Contribution guides
- [docs/handbook/](docs/handbook/) - Developer handbook
- [docs/](docs/) - General documentation

## Reporting Issues

Include in bug reports:

- Operating system and version
- ProjT Launcher version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs from `~/.local/share/ProjT/logs/`

---

## FAQ

Q: Why is my MR failing CI?

- Run clang-format
- Sign off commits (`git commit -s`)
- Add tests for new code

Q: Can I use a different Qt version?

- No. Exact version matching is required.

Q: How do I update a fork library?

- Document changes thoroughly
- Test all dependent code
- Submit separate MR for library update
