# Troubleshooting

This is a collection of helpful information for frequent problems when using ProjT Launcher.

## Minecraft 1.16.5 with Minecraft Forge and Java 8u321+

Older versions of Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.16.5 cause the game to crash on launch, as they do not support the latest revisions of Java 8.

You can fix this by changing the Forge version in the launcher to the latest or recommended version.
For that go to **Version** ??**Select Forge** ??**Change Version** ??**Select newest version** ??**OK**

Alternatively you can download and use an older Java version (i.e. Java 8u312)

## Minecraft Forge failing to run processor

If you are getting an error saying `Failed to run processor: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused` when trying to launch a Minecraft Forge instance, you might have connectivity issues with IPv6.

A workaround for this issue is adding the following JVM argument:

```text
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
```

## Common Launcher-related issues

#### "MSVCP140_2.dll was not found"?

Since ProjT Launcher 0.0.1, ProjT is compiled using [MSVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B) on Windows.
As a consequence of this, like most apps on Windows, you have to install vcredist for ProjT to run.
You need:

* [vcredist 2022 x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you're using ProjTLauncher-Windows-MSVC (the recommended version for Windows 10 64 bit/Windows 11)
* [vcredist 2022 arm64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe) if you're using ProjTLauncher-Windows-MSVC-arm64 (the recommended version for Windows 10/11 on ARM)

#### How do I open a .zip file?

Windows by default can "open" **.zip** archive files, but in order to use ProjT Launcher, you will want to **extract** it instead.

#### Windows Protected my PC?

This is unfortunately **normal behaviour** due to the nature of the Windows app signing process. ProjT Launcher has yet to purchase a signature, however, with enough funding, we may choose to do so in the future. ProjT Launcher is an **open-source** application. As a result of this, all of the source code is public, and can be audited by any individual or group. If you would like to do so yourself, you can do so here: <https://github.com/Project-Tick/ProjT-Launcher>

If you are **comfortable** and **trust** ProjT Launcher, then you can click on the **More info** button, and then do the same on the **Run anyway** one too.

<!-- #### How do I install the ProjT Launcher Flatpak on my Linux system?

Detailed instructions on setting-up your system to install Flatpak applications from Flathub, can be found here: <https://flatpak.org/setup/> -->

#### How do I open the ProjT Launcher AppImage on my Linux system?

Depending on your system, you may need to grant the ProjT Launcher AppImage **executable** permissions.

You can do this by opening your system's terminal application, **making sure to navigate to the location of the downloaded AppImage,** before granting the execute permission using this command:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ProjTLauncher-Linux-{{version.current}}-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Please note,** that depending on the version of ProjT Launcher that you have downloaded, you may have to **change the version number** in the command above.

If you want to simplify the installation of the AppImage, use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher). Note that this won't work on non-systemd system, and we recommend just using packages.

#### ProjT Launcher isn't using my system theme

ProjT Launcher has support for Qt 6.
This means that some themes and theming platforms like KDE Plasma's theming will not work on builds using that version of the Qt toolkit.

#### I want to make my system install portable

On ProjT Launcher you can make any install portable (or making portable installs system) just by adding (or removing) portable.txt to the ProjT Launcher root directory.
